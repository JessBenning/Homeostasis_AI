# UI considerations

## Group the following:
* Group creation - Creating a group and inviting members (Available to all)
* Group management - Renaming, deleting, viewing members and removing members (Available only once you own a group)
* Leave a group leaving a group can be a setting by itself (Available once you are a member of a group)
* Joining a group does not need UI elements
