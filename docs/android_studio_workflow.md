# Android Studio Workflow for Homeostasis App

This document explains how to use Android Studio with code generated by Roo for the Homeostasis app development.

## Integration Workflow

### 1. Initial Project Setup

When you're ready to start coding the Homeostasis app:

1. **Create a new Android project in Android Studio**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "New Project"
   - Choose "Empty Activity" or "Empty Views Activity" template
   - Set application name to "Homeostasis"
   - Select Kotlin as the programming language
   - Set minimum SDK to Android 8.0 (API level 26) as specified in our requirements
   - Click "Finish"

2. **Import code generated by Roo**:
   - Any code files generated by Roo can be copied directly into your Android Studio project
   - Place the files in their appropriate directories according to the package structure
   - Android Studio will automatically recognize and index the new files

### 2. Project Structure

The project structure in Android Studio should follow the architecture outlined in our documentation:

```
app/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/com/homeostasis/app/
│   │   │   ├── ui/              # UI components (Activities, Fragments)
│   │   │   │   ├── auth/        # Authentication screens
│   │   │   │   ├── tasks/       # Task management screens
│   │   │   │   ├── shopping/    # Shopping list screens
│   │   │   │   └── profile/     # User profile screens
│   │   │   ├── viewmodel/       # ViewModels for each feature
│   │   │   ├── repository/      # Data repositories
│   │   │   ├── data/            # Data models and sources
│   │   │   │   ├── model/       # Data classes
│   │   │   │   ├── local/       # Room database
│   │   │   │   └── remote/      # Firebase services
│   │   │   └── util/            # Utility classes
│   │   ├── res/                 # Resources
│   │   └── AndroidManifest.xml
│   └── test/                    # Unit and instrumentation tests
├── build.gradle                 # App-level build configuration
└── proguard-rules.pro           # ProGuard rules
```

### 3. Firebase Integration

To integrate Firebase with your Android Studio project:

1. Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
3. Follow the setup instructions to:
   - Download the `google-services.json` file
   - Place it in the `app/` directory
   - Add the required dependencies to your Gradle files
4. Enable the Firebase services needed (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

### 4. Development Workflow

Once the project is set up, the development workflow would be:

1. **Implement data models**:
   - Create the Kotlin data classes for User, Task, TaskHistory, etc.
   - Set up Room database for local storage
   - Implement Firebase repositories

2. **Implement ViewModels**:
   - Create ViewModels for each feature area
   - Implement business logic and data operations

3. **Build UI components**:
   - Implement Activities and Fragments
   - Create layouts using XML or Jetpack Compose
   - Connect UI to ViewModels

4. **Test and iterate**:
   - Use Android Studio's emulator or physical devices for testing
   - Debug using Android Studio's built-in tools
   - Refine the implementation based on testing results

### 5. Code Generation and Manual Editing

When working with code generated by Roo:

1. **Initial generation**: Roo can generate boilerplate code, data models, and basic UI components based on the specifications in our documentation.

2. **Manual customization**: You can then customize and extend this code in Android Studio:
   - Add specific business logic
   - Refine UI components
   - Implement additional features
   - Optimize performance

3. **Iterative development**: For subsequent features or changes:
   - You can have Roo generate additional code snippets
   - Integrate these snippets into your existing codebase
   - Ensure proper integration with your customizations

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Control

- Commit regularly to your GitHub repository
- Use feature branches for new functionality
- Create pull requests for code review before merging

### 2. Code Organization

- Follow the package structure outlined in the architecture
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Use consistent naming conventions

### 3. Testing

- Write unit tests for repositories and ViewModels
- Create UI tests for critical user flows
- Test offline functionality thoroughly

### 4. Documentation

- Add comments to complex code sections
- Keep the architecture documentation updated as the implementation evolves
- Document any deviations from the original design

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Best of both worlds**: You get the benefit of Roo's code generation capabilities while maintaining the full power and flexibility of Android Studio.

2. **Industry-standard tools**: Android Studio is the official IDE for Android development, offering the best debugging, profiling, and deployment tools.

3. **Seamless integration**: Code generated by Roo can be directly used in Android Studio without any special adapters or converters.

4. **Flexibility**: You can choose which parts to generate with Roo and which parts to code manually, based on your preferences and the complexity of each component.

This workflow allows you to leverage both the efficiency of AI-assisted code generation and the comprehensive development environment of Android Studio to build the Homeostasis app effectively.
